       "      <td>I had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so I ordered TWO band AND cup sizes UP and it was still too small!  Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.\\n\\nUPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.\\n\\nTake the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.</td>\n",

The fabric is a nice thin material, but it is a little thin in the legs.  I wish it was thicker.  The material is soft and comfortable.  I will keep it.  I ordered a half size up and it fits great.  I wear a 9 1/2.  I like that the strap is longer than the waistband, which is nice.  I am 5'5\" and the size 6 fits great.  I am a medium.  The bra is too short.  It is a little narrow for me, but I think it would be a nice addition to my wardrobe.  I will be buying another one in different colors.  I have a small tummy and I ordered a medium.  I wear a 9 1/2 in pants.  I would recommend this bra.  I am 5'8\" and the length was perfect.  I love the color and it is very comfortable.\\nI would recommend this to anyone.I was very happy with this shirt!  It's very pretty and the fabric is soft and nice!  The fit is perfect!  I bought a small and it fit perfectly!  It is well made and it's very comfortable.I like the leggings but they are not as comfortable. I am a 36D and ordered a medium and it was too big.

You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.

Go 1 size up if you intend on layering.\\n\\nI've purchased other items from this manufacturer, and frankly, this item was a let down.  It's not warm enough when I need it to be warm.  I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.\\n\\nAnd to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.

The fabric is a nice thin material and the color is vibrant. It's a little thin on me but it's worth it. The material is soft and comfortable. I love the color and the fit. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I'm a size 6 and it's a bit long on me so I ordered a 6 in order to fit the smaller size. I'm 5'3\" and it fits perfect and I got it in a medium.

       "      <td>I work in the wedding industry and have to work long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.</td>\n",

Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.\\n\\nUPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.\\n\\nTake the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.  \n",

It is a little large for my small size, but I think it is a nice fit.  The fabric is a nice thin material, but it is a little thin in the legs.  I wish it was thicker.  The material is soft and comfortable.  I will keep it.  I ordered a half size up and it fits great.  I wear a 9 1/2.  I like that the strap is longer than the waistband, which is nice.  I am 5'5\" and the size 6 fits great.  I am a medium.  The bra is too short.  It is a little narrow for me, but I think it would be a nice addition to my wardrobe.  I will be buying another one in different colors.  I have a small tummy and I ordered a medium.  I wear a 9 1/2 in pants.  I would recommend this bra.  I am 5'8\" and the length was perfect.  I love the color and it is very comfortable.\\nI would recommend this to anyone.I was very happy with this shirt!  It's very pretty and the fabric is soft and nice!  The fit is perfect!  I bought a small and it fit perfectly!  It is well made and it's very comfortable.I like the leggings but they are not as comfortable. I am a 36D and ordered a medium and it was too big. I am going to return it. I returned it. I am very pleased with this purchase and will be ordering another one.I bought these shoes to wear to work when I was out walking in the rain.  \n",

You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.

I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.\\n\\nAnd to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I ordered the size 6.5 and it fit perfectly. The fabric is a nice thin material and the color is vibrant. It's a little thin on me but it's worth it. The material is soft and comfortable. I love the color and the fit. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I'm a size 6 and it's a bit long on me so I ordered a 6 in order to fit the smaller size. I'm 5'3\" and it fits perfect and I got it in a medium. It's a nice dress and I'm very pleased with it. I like that it's a bit small for me and I can wear it with a top or skirt. I also like that the fabric is made of a good material. I wear a size 5 and it fits well. I'm 5'3\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'6\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I wear a size 10.5 and it's a little tight on me. I have a small waist and it's not too tight on me. It's a nice little dress. I will buy more colors.Very nice dress.  It is well made and it is very comfortable.  I received a free sample and will see if I can wear it again.  I would definitely buy another one.  I am very happy with this dress.I love these boots!  I have been wearing them for almost 8 months now and I love them so much that I purchased a second pair.  They are very comfortable and look great.   \n",

I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.  \n",

Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.\\n\\nUPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.\\n\\nTake the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I wasn't sure exactly what it would be. It is a little large for my small size, but I think it is a nice fit.  The fabric is a nice thin material, but it is a little thin in the legs.  I wish it was thicker.  The material is soft and comfortable.  I will keep it.  I ordered a half size up and it fits great.  I wear a 9 1/2.  I like that the strap is longer than the waistband, which is nice.  I am 5'5\" and the size 6 fits great.  I am a medium.  The bra is too short.  It is a little narrow for me, but I think it would be a nice addition to my wardrobe.  I will be buying another one in different colors.  I have a small tummy and I ordered a medium.  I wear a 9 1/2 in pants.  I would recommend this bra.  I am 5'8\" and the length was perfect.  I love the color and it is very comfortable.\\nI would recommend this to anyone.I was very happy with this shirt!  It's very pretty and the fabric is soft and nice!  The fit is perfect!  I bought a small and it fit perfectly!  It is well made and it's very comfortable.I like the leggings but they are not as comfortable. I am a 36D and ordered a medium and it was too big. I am going to return it. I returned it. I am very pleased with this purchase and will be ordering another one.I bought these shoes to wear to work when I was out walking in the rain.</td>\n",

How is that for 3-in-1 systems?\\n\\nReminiscent of what Lands End sells as a \"Squall Jacket\", or what uniform and corporate wear sellers call a Three Season Jacket.\\n\\nWater and wind resistant shell.  Microfleece lined body.  Smooth polyester lining in sleeves.  Left hand side, Napoleon style, inside pocket with a hook and loop closure.  Adjustable sleeve cuffs.  Hemline cinch cord with toggles.  Molded plastic chain style, off brand, slide fastener.\\n\\nPolyester insulation is spilling out due to poor quality stitching.

You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.  You will not be going for bike rides, checking your property's fence line by horseback, riding a motorcycle, playing golf, pier fishing, lap dancing, picking strawberries, calling ducks, or anything else in the rain.\\n\\nI guess if you name your company, 32Degrees Weatherproof, the customer does not have a reasonable expectation that your garments will keep them dry &amp; warm.\\n\\nGarment fits tight across the shoulders, back, chest, and arms.  Go 1 size up if you intend on layering.\\n\\nI've purchased other items from this manufacturer, and frankly, this item was a let down.  It's not warm enough when I need it to be warm.  I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.\\n\\nAnd to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.

       "      <td>I liked nothing about this dress. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I ordered the size 6.5 and it fit perfectly. The fabric is a nice thin material and the color is vibrant. It's a little thin on me but it's worth it. The material is soft and comfortable. I love the color and the fit. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I'm a size 6 and it's a bit long on me so I ordered a 6 in order to fit the smaller size. I'm 5'3\" and it fits perfect and I got it in a medium. It's a nice dress and I'm very pleased with it. I like that it's a bit small for me and I can wear it with a top or skirt. I also like that the fabric is made of a good material. I wear a size 5 and it fits well. I'm 5'3\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'6\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I wear a size 10.5 and it's a little tight on me. I have a small waist and it's not too tight on me. It's a nice little dress. I will buy more colors.Very nice dress.  It is well made and it is very comfortable.  I received a free sample and will see if I can wear it again.  I would definitely buy another one.  I am very happy with this dress.I love these boots!  I have been wearing them for almost 8 months now and I love them so much that I purchased a second pair.  They are very comfortable and look great.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I work in the wedding industry and have to work long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.</td>\n",

Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.\\n\\nUPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.\\n\\nTake the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.  \n",

It is a little large for my small size, but I think it is a nice fit.  The fabric is a nice thin material, but it is a little thin in the legs.  I wish it was thicker.  The material is soft and comfortable.  I will keep it.  I ordered a half size up and it fits great.  I wear a 9 1/2.  I like that the strap is longer than the waistband, which is nice.  I am 5'5\" and the size 6 fits great.  I am a medium.  The bra is too short.  It is a little narrow for me, but I think it would be a nice addition to my wardrobe.  I will be buying another one in different colors.  I have a small tummy and I ordered a medium.  I wear a 9 1/2 in pants.  I would recommend this bra.  I am 5'8\" and the length was perfect.  I love the color and it is very comfortable.\\nI would recommend this to anyone.I was very happy with this shirt!  It's very pretty and the fabric is soft and nice!  The fit is perfect!

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I ordered the size 6.5 and it fit perfectly. The fabric is a nice thin material and the color is vibrant. It's a little thin on me but it's worth it. The material is soft and comfortable. I love the color and the fit. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I'm a size 6 and it's a bit long on me so I ordered a 6 in order to fit the smaller size. I'm 5'3\" and it fits perfect and I got it in a medium. It's a nice dress and I'm very pleased with it. I like that it's a bit small for me and I can wear it with a top or skirt. I also like that the fabric is made of a good material. I wear a size 5 and it fits well. I'm 5'3\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'6\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I wear a size 10.5 and it's a little tight on me. I have a small waist and it's not too tight on me. It's a nice little dress. I will buy more colors.Very nice dress.  It is well made and it is very comfortable.  I received a free sample and will see if I can wear it again.  I would definitely buy another one.  I am very happy with this dress.I love these boots!  I have been wearing them for almost 8 months now and I love them so much that I purchased a second pair.  They are very comfortable and look great.   \n",

I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.  \n",

       "      <td>I had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so I ordered TWO band AND cup sizes UP and it was still too small!  Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.\\n\\nUPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.\\n\\nTake the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.</td>\n",

Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.\\n\\nUPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.\\n\\nTake the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.  \n",

It is a little large for my small size, but I think it is a nice fit.  The fabric is a nice thin material, but it is a little thin in the legs.  I wish it was thicker.  The material is soft and comfortable.  I will keep it.  I ordered a half size up and it fits great.  I wear a 9 1/2.  I like that the strap is longer than the waistband, which is nice.  I am 5'5\" and the size 6 fits great.  I am a medium.  The bra is too short.  It is a little narrow for me, but I think it would be a nice addition to my wardrobe.  I will be buying another one in different colors.  I have a small tummy and I ordered a medium.  I wear a 9 1/2 in pants.  I would recommend this bra.  I am 5'8\" and the length was perfect.  I love the color and it is very comfortable.\\nI would recommend this to anyone.I was very happy with this shirt!  It's very pretty and the fabric is soft and nice!  The fit is perfect!  I bought a small and it fit perfectly!  It is well made and it's very comfortable.I like the leggings but they are not as comfortable. I am a 36D and ordered a medium and it was too big. I am going to return it. I returned it. I am very pleased with this purchase and will be ordering another one.I bought these shoes to wear to work when I was out walking in the rain.  \n",

I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.\\n\\nAnd to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I ordered the size 6.5 and it fit perfectly. The fabric is a nice thin material and the color is vibrant. It's a little thin on me but it's worth it. The material is soft and comfortable. I love the color and the fit. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I'm a size 6 and it's a bit long on me so I ordered a 6 in order to fit the smaller size. I'm 5'3\" and it fits perfect and I got it in a medium. It's a nice dress and I'm very pleased with it. I like that it's a bit small for me and I can wear it with a top or skirt. I also like that the fabric is made of a good material. I wear a size 5 and it fits well. I'm 5'3\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'6\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I wear a size 10.5 and it's a little tight on me. I have a small waist and it's not too tight on me. It's a nice little dress. I will buy more colors.Very nice dress.  It is well made and it is very comfortable.  I received a free sample and will see if I can wear it again.  I would definitely buy another one.  I am very happy with this dress.I love these boots!  I have been wearing them for almost 8 months now and I love them so much that I purchased a second pair.  They are very comfortable and look great.   \n",

I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.  \n",

       "      <td>I work in the wedding industry and have to work long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.</td>\n",

The material is soft and comfortable.  I will keep it.  I ordered a half size up and it fits great.  I wear a 9 1/2.  I like that the strap is longer than the waistband, which is nice.  I am 5'5\" and the size 6 fits great.  I am a medium.  The bra is too short.  It is a little narrow for me, but I think it would be a nice addition to my wardrobe.  I will be buying another one in different colors.  I have a small tummy and I ordered a medium.  I wear a 9 1/2 in pants.  I would recommend this bra.  I am 5'8\" and the length was perfect.  I love the color and it is very comfortable.\\nI would recommend this to anyone.I was very happy with this shirt!  It's very pretty and the fabric is soft and nice!  The fit is perfect!  I bought a small and it fit perfectly!  It is well made and it's very comfortable.I like the leggings but they are not as comfortable. I am a 36D and ordered a medium and it was too big. I am going to return it. I returned it. I am very pleased with this purchase and will be ordering another one.I bought these shoes to wear to work when I was out walking in the rain.  \n",
       "40429  You can wear the hood by itself, wear it with the hood, or wear just the jacket without the hood.  How is that for 3-in-1 systems?\\n\\nReminiscent of what Lands End sells as a \"Squall Jacket\", or what uniform and corporate wear sellers call a Three Season Jacket.\\n\\nWater and wind resistant shell.  Microfleece lined body.  Smooth polyester lining in sleeves.  Left hand side, Napoleon style, inside pocket with a hook and loop closure.  Adjustable sleeve cuffs.  Hemline cinch cord with toggles.  Molded plastic chain style, off brand, slide fastener.\\n\\nPolyester insulation is spilling out due to poor quality stitching.  Item was delivered with a broken main zipper.\\n\\nI can wear this jacket over just a t-shirt, and expect to stay warm @ 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and no wind.\\n\\nIf it was foggy, or there's a light drizzle, I would have no problem depending on this jacket to go 300 - 500 feet in order to get to my car in the parking lot.\\n\\nBetter garments feature Gore-Tex, Hippora, HyVent, DWR.....this jacket features no technology.  You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.  You will not be going for bike rides, checking your property's fence line by horseback, riding a motorcycle, playing golf, pier fishing, lap dancing, picking strawberries, calling ducks, or anything else in the rain.\\n\\nI guess if you name your company, 32Degrees Weatherproof, the customer does not have a reasonable expectation that your garments will keep them dry & warm.\\n\\nGarment fits tight across the shoulders, back, chest, and arms.  Go 1 size up if you intend on layering.\\n\\nI've purchased other items from this manufacturer, and frankly, this item was a let down.  It's not warm enough when I need it to be warm.  I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.\\n\\nAnd to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.  This jacket does not have a removeable liner!  \n",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I ordered the size 6.5 and it fit perfectly. The fabric is a nice thin material and the color is vibrant. It's a little thin on me but it's worth it. The material is soft and comfortable. I love the color and the fit. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I'm a size 6 and it's a bit long on me so I ordered a 6 in order to fit the smaller size. I'm 5'3\" and it fits perfect and I got it in a medium. It's a nice dress and I'm very pleased with it. I like that it's a bit small for me and I can wear it with a top or skirt. I also like that the fabric is made of a good material. I wear a size 5 and it fits well. I'm 5'3\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'6\" and it fits just right. I'm 5'4\" and it fits just right. I wear a size 10.5 and it's a little tight on me. I have a small waist and it's not too tight on me. It's a nice little dress. I will buy more colors.Very nice dress.  It is well made and it is very comfortable.  I received a free sample and will see if I can wear it again.  I would definitely buy another one.  I am very happy with this dress.I love these boots!  I have been wearing them for almost 8 months now and I love them so much that I purchased a second pair.  They are very comfortable and look great.   \n",

I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little \"sticky\" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.  "
